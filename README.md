### P1 - Popular Movies Stage 1
***Included Udacity course: [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853)***

Popular Movies is an app, which enables the user to instantly look up the most popular (or top rated) movies. Starting in a recycler view, the posters of the movies are shown. When the user selects a movie, a detail view shows further information, like title, year, rating, and a short description. Movie data is asynchronously fetched from [TheMovieDB.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The user is able to sort the movies by rating, or popularity. The whole project is started from scratch, and is continued in Stage 2 (see below).

### P2 - Popular Movies Stage 2

Stage 2 of Popular Movies enhances the experience of the app. The user is now able to watch trailers, read reviews, and also an offline functionality is introduced. When a movie is marked as a "favorite", the movie information gets stored in a local database, which preserves the data in a persistent manner. So the user can see movie information of favorites also when there is no internet connection. To access the favorites, another toolbar entry is added. 
Finally, the app design is optimized for tablet usage, providing a master-detail layout.
